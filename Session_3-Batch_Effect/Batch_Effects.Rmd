# Introduction 

 - Batch effects (Leek et al., 2010): *sub-groups of measurements that have qualitatively different behaviour
across conditions and are unrelated to the biological or scientific variables in a study* . 

    + Batch effects can arise from taking measurements in different laboratory conditions, at different dates, with
different reagent lots, manipulated by different technical staff, etc. 

    + With an appropriate __block design__ batch effects can be identified, adjusted and eventually corrected.

    + In the worst case of a bad experimental design, batch effects can potentially be correlated to the outcome
of interest and lead the researcher to incorrect conclusions.
